# Password Generator

## Description

I built this website to help anyone generate a password between 8-128 characters, with any type of characters they wish (uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters).

This project helped me learn a lot about functionsa and arrays in JS!

Here's a link to try it out: https://zeinahares.github.io/Password-Generator/

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Click on the Generate button to begin selecting your criteria through prompts on your web browser.

Then, you can input how long you want your password to be between 8-128 characters. It also asks whether you want lowercase, uppercase, numeric or special characters through a series of confirm prompts. If the length is not between 8-128 or no character type was chosen, you get an error message telling you to try again.
